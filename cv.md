## On what we can work together

As a full-stack engineer with a strong background in AI and machine learning together with a passion for creating scalable systems, I bring a unique set of skills. Here are some areas we can collaborate effectively to drive business value:

* AI Web Applications: Leverage my expertise in full-stack development and knowledge of AI to create AI-powered web applications. We can integrate data generated by AI models into Django or FastAPI backends to develop intuitive frontends.
* Edge Computing Solutions: Creating scalable systems to collect data generated by AI models running on edge devices and make it available through an API.
* API Design and Development: Creating robust, scalable and well-documented APIs using Django Rest Framework or FastAPI.
* Crawling and Scraping: Creating web crawlers and scrapers using Scrapy, Selenium, or other tools.

### Tools I am currently using

* Python3
  * Django Web Framework (and Django Rest Framework)
  * FastAPI
* Postgresql (with SQLAlchemy and Alembic)
* MongoDB
* Kafka
* Redis
* Docker

### Tools I'm trying out

* [UV Python Package and Project Manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
* [Piccolo ORM](https://piccolo-orm.com/)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)

### Tools I used before

* RabbitMQ (with Celery)
* VueJS
* React
* Scrapy
* Selenium
* Apache Spark
* GoLang
* Java

### Other

* Ansible
* Github Actions
* Cloud services, including AWS (EBS, S3, SES, EC2), Digital Ocean, Hetzner and Google Cloud

## Work Experiences

* [SmartCow](https://www.smartcow.ai/) [June 2022 - Present] - Smartcow, is an Nvidia partner which designs and manufactures edge devices, capable of running AI models. At Smartcow my main work involves creating scalable systems able to collect data generated by AI models running on edge devices and making it available through an API.
* [Umnai](https://umnai.com/) [September 2021 - June 2022] - Part of a small team creating a Python library with the goal of helping developers create Explainable AI.
  - Technologies used include Python with Pyspark, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy and Pandas.
* [Gaming Innovation Group](https://www.gig.com/) [February 2018 - September 2021] - Core part of the team creating [GiG Comply](https://comply.gig.com/) from scratch to crawling and analysing 1k webpages/hour.
  - Some of the technologies used include Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Postgresql, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Nginx, Docker, and Ansible.
  - Application of CNNs to detect logos in images.
* [RS2 Software](https://www.rs2.com/) [July 2015 - January 2018] - Formed part of the Delivery Team, and was personally responsible for developing schema management tools. I also wrote and maintained plugins
for Atlassian Jira using Java and Vanilla JS. As part of my role, I also provided training and troubleshooting support to clients.

## Education

**B.Sc in Artificial Intelligence (2015) - University of Malta**

The dissertation ‚ÄúAutomated pathology detection in the brain‚Äù focused on the possibility of using Machine Learning algorithms to ease the process of detecting pathologies in CT Scans of the brain. Decision trees were used with the goal of explaining how a decision was derived.
