# About

Hi there, I'm Daniel, and here's a bit about me:

- 👨‍💻 I have a passion for Machine Learning, and I'm always eager to explore its ever-growing number of possibilities.
- 🌐 I work at [SmartCow](smartcow.ai), an Nvidia partner manufacturing Edge devices. My day to day involves collecting data created by AI models and make it available through an API.
- 🏋️ I'm an advocate for an active lifestyle. You can often find me hitting the gym or going for a refreshing run to keep both my body and mind in shape.
- ☕ A coffee enthusiast. A good cup of coffee can make any day better.
- 📈 I'm also keen on analyzing companies and the stock market. It's fascinating to consider investment opportunities.
- 🏡 [Rebecca](https://rebmdsportsnutrition.com/about/) and I host guests at [our holiday home](https://airbnb.com.mt/h/xlendi-sea-view) with whom we share lovely Gozo.

Feel free to reach out and connect if you share any of these interests or if you simply want to chat about the exciting worlds of tech, sports, or investments. I'm always up for a good conversation!

Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities together.
