title: "Day 0: I'm crawling supermarkets and comparing prices"
lead: I intend to crawl a few supermarkets with the goal of getting the cheapest checkout.
---

Prices in Malta (and to the best of my knowledge around the world) have been on a steady rise. I am interested in seeing if buying from one shop instead of another will yield significant savings.


Plan

Day 1: Write a crawler to retrieve specific pages from Smart Supermarket. These should write to a RabbitMQ Fanout
Day 2: Generic Smart Supermaket Crawler
Day 3: Reading messages from RabbitMQ: Create a Piccolo ORM/Fast API based project.
