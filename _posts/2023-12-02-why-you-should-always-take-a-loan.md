title: You should take a loan and pay interest
lead:

There is a very valid reason why any successful business (or government) takes on debt, and is very happy to pay the interest. It makes sense. Let us dive immediately into an example. 

Mark, a bright engineer, earning around $5k per month starts saving to buy his first property. The properties he is looking at cost around $300k to buy, and in 1 year he is able to save up $30k for the downpayment. Mark immediately finds a property for $285k and enters into a promise of sale. After 1 year, 6 months he is the owner of the property*. To finalize the deal, Mark took out a loan for $256k with an interest payment of 3.5%. He is due to pay $1000 per month, and is able to save $3000 per month.

There are two options, either pay down the loan as fast as possible, to save on the interest owed to the bank, or pay the interest and use the money elsewhere. Clearly it only makes sense to use the money elsewhere, if that money can bring back more then 3.5% interest rate.

As a bright engineer, Mark knows of various bonds and equities he can use his money for. Since he is risk-averse, and does not understand the world of equities he decides to buy bonds. Every month Mark pays down the $1000 he is due to pay the bank, but with the extra $2000 he buys bonds at an average rate of 5.5%. This is a bright idea, as although he is not saving 3.5%, he is making 5.5%, meaning that every month Mark is pocketing a 2% difference. Let's get into some simple maths to see how this plays out.

Month 1:  $2000 		x (2% /12) = $3.33 **
Month 2:  $4003.33 		x (2% /12) = $6.67
Month 3:  $6,010.01		x (2% /12) = $10.02
Month 4:  $8,020.02		x (2% /12) = $13.37
Month 5:  $10,033.39	x (2% /12) = $16.72
Month 6:  $12,050.11	x (2% /12) = $20.08
Month 7:  $14,070.19	x (2% /12) = $23.45
Month 8:  $16,093.65	x (2% /12) = $26.82
Month 9:  $18,120.47	x (2% /12) = $30.20
Month 10: $20,150.67	x (2% /12) = $33.58
Month 11: $22,184.25	x (2% /12) = $36.97
Month 12: $24,221.23	x (2% /12) = $40.37

If we sum up, after 1 year Mark gained $261.60c from avoiding to pay down his loan as fast as possible. But the exciting part is that the loan is 40 years long. Let us illustrate the benefit Mark gains from not paying down the loan in that timeframe (480 months) assuming he keeps up his $3000 savings rate:
