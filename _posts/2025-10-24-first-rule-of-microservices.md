People want to scale their SaaS like it’s Netflix or Facebook before they even have 10 users.

Software architecture isn’t about building a scalable system from day one. It’s about building the right system for your current needs—nothing more, nothing less.
Kubernetes is cool.
Splitting backend and frontend is great.
But for most projects, they’re **unnecessary complexity**. Start with a **monolith**. It’s:

 - **Faster to build**
 - **Cheaper to develop and run**
 - **Easier to understand** — one person can hold the entire system in their head

When (and if) your project grows to the point where microservices become necessary, you’ll have the revenue, team, and data to justify the leap. And in 9 out of 10 cases, your real bottleneck will be **database queries**, not service boundaries.

## Things to Keep in Mind with a Monolith: Modular Design

A monolith doesn’t mean a *large mess*. The key is **modular design**—organizing your codebase into **clear, independent domains** from the start, even within a single application. This is a core principle in Django based development, and Django apps.

### What is Modular Design?

> **Modular design** means structuring your monolith as a collection of well-defined, loosely coupled modules—each responsible for a specific business domain (e.g., `users`, `billing`, `notifications`, `inventory`).

Each module should have:
- Its own folder and **Django app**
- Its own models, views, serializers, and URLs
- Minimal cross-app dependencies

### Django Already Gives You Modularity — Use It!

Django’s **apps** are *perfect* for modular design. Each `django-app` is a self-contained unit—exactly what you need for future extraction.

```text
myproject/
├── users/
│   ├── apps.py         # AppConfig(label='users')
│   ├── models.py       # UserProfile, Preferences
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── tests/
├── billing/
│   ├── apps.py         # AppConfig(label='billing')
│   ├── models.py       # Invoice, Subscription, Payment
│   ├── views.py
│   ├── serializers.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── tasks.py        # send_invoice_email
├── notifications/
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── models.py       # NotificationLog
│   ├── services.py     # send_email(), send_push()
│   └── tasks.py        # Celery tasks
└── core/               # shared utilities, settings
```

**Pro tip**: Use `AppConfig` with explicit `label` and `name` to avoid naming collisions and make schema separation crystal clear.

```python
# billing/apps.py
from django.apps import AppConfig

class BillingConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'billing'
    label = 'billing'  # DB table prefix: billing_invoice
```

### Why It Matters: Future-Proof Extraction

Modular design is your **escape hatch**.

When the time comes to scale, you don’t rewrite—you **extract**.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Monolith] --> B[Modular Monolith<br/>(Django apps)]
    B --> C[Extract `billing` app<br/>→ billing-service]
    C --> D[Deploy Independently<br/>+ API Gateway + Message Queue]
```

Because `billing` was already isolated:
- No tangled `import` spaghetti
- Clear database ownership (`billing_*` tables)
- Independent tests and admin
- Can be rewritten to FastAPI, Go, or Node with minimal effects to other parts of the project

### TL;DR

**Start simple. Start monolithic. But build with Django apps.**  
Each app = one bounded context.  
That way, if you ever *do* need microservices, you’re not refactoring—you’re just **promoting an app**.
