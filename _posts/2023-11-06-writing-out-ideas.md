title: Writing out ideas
lead: My main interests and what you could expect.
---

I created a blog section to this portfolio site in order to write down and have a quick reference to different topics I'm working with or come across. So expect the
blog to be a set of jumbled ideas from various fields I'm interested in. These personal notes should help me and others get into a subject quickly in the future.

For reference my main interests are Software Development, Finance and Financial Markets, Training and Nutrition, and ... Coffee. I'll probably stick to these for most of the time.
